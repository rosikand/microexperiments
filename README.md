# Microexperiments
Experimenting with changing one or more control variables with the hope of improving upon the methodology for greater results. 

## Experiments
- `sorted-first-layer`: in this directory, I experiment with sorting the data before feeding it into the neural network. In other words, the first layer of neurons are sorted. Specifically, I use the MNIST dataset and sort by row array--not the entire image.
